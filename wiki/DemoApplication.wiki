#summary Getting to work the demo application

= Introduction =

Let's get the demo application working!


= Installing the application =

  * Check out project *struts2-jq-antilia* and *struts2-jq-antilia-test* from SVN (see http://code.google.com/p/antilia-struts/source/checkout for details on how to do that). 
  * The demo application assume you are using eclipse as your IDE (sorry, no maven yet). 
  * There is a launcher struts-2-antilia you can use to start the demo application. This will launch a Jetty server as well as derby network server.
  * The application should be up an running... To see it browse at http://localhost:8080/struts2/.You should see something like.

  * But still we have to create the database used by the demo. For this there is a an ANT launcher called *buildDataBase2*. This will launch a DDL utils script taht wil construct the database. To insert data for the application just run the class *com.antilia.struts2.entities.InsertCountries*. *IMPORTANT*: mind that the application should be running when execute the script, so that the derby server is up an running.
  * Now if you browse at http://localhost:8080/struts2/example/AntiliaJQueryDB you should see something like:
